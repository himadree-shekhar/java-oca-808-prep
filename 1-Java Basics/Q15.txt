Question: 
Given:

public class Triangle{
    public int base;
    public int height;
    public double area;
    
    public Triangle(int base, int height){
        this.base = base; this.height = height;
        updateArea();
    }

    void updateArea(){
        area = base*height/2;
    }
    public void setBase(int b){ base  = b; updateArea(); }
    public void setHeight(int h){ height  = h; updateArea(); }
}

The above class needs to protect an invariant on the "area" field. Which three members must have the public access modifiers removed to ensure that the invariant is maintained?

You had to select 3 options :
(A) the base field
(B) the height field
(C) the area field
(D) the Triangle constructor
(E) the setBase method
(F) the setHeight method
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer : A, B, C 

In this context, the invariant is the mathematical rule unchanged 
that area must always be base*height/2.

Public access allows external code from directly modifying them 
and potentially breaking the invariant.
