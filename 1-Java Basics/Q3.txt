Question: 
Given the following code: 

interface Movable {
    int offset = 100;
    public void move(int dx);
}

interface Growable {
    public void grow(int dy);
}

class Animal implements Movable, Growable {
    public void move(int dx) {}
    public void grow(int dy) {}
}

Please select 1 options:

(A) Animal class illustrates Java's support for multiple inheritance of type
(B) Animal class illustrates Java's support for multiple inheritance of state
(C) Animal class illustrates Java's support for multiple inheritance of type as well as state
(D) Animal class illustrates Java's support for multiple implementation inheritance

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer : 
(A) : 
Note: Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes.

But, The Java programming language supports multiple inheritance of type, 
which is the ability of a class to implement more than one interface. 
Here(the types being the interfaces themselves).
